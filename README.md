## Number Match Puzzle – Deterministic System

This project replaces RNG with a deterministic difficulty-controlled system.

### Core Ideas
- Sawtooth difficulty curve
- Guaranteed solvable boards
- Smart add-row injection
- Rescue mechanic for frustration control

### Why RNG fails
Random boards cause impossible states. This system ensures fairness.

### Difficulty Flow
Levels increase in difficulty, drop at relief levels (6, 11).

### Completion Guarantee
95% probability via rescue logic and controlled injections.
